# Intelligent-Scissors
Developed an application which snaps to the objectsâ€™ boundaries. Constructed graph for a given image. Calculated the shortest path from a pixel to all pixels using Dijkstra algorithm. Backtracked the shortest path from a mouse position to a chosen pixel. Drew the path on the image. Cropped the image by applying flood-area algorithm.
